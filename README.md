# Pro Football Focus Code Sample
This code sample was built using:
- **[Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli)**:  A Preact Progressive Web App starter kit. Preact is a lightweight and fast framework that has the same API and patterns as React.
-  **[React Table](https://react-table.js.org/)**: a lightweight, fast and extendable datagrid built for React.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve
```
